- docs contains the static site usable by gh pages



local:
- tried opening site files copied from the gh repo using local on the win11 pc, didn't work
- opened the same site files(for tobyhogan-space on my laptop macosx and it did work ), although not sure why
    - perhaps local is too local and some files are only stored on machine?


-> I got it to work by exporting the site when it was working from the laptop through local, then importing it through local on the desktop



simplystatic / static site exporting:
- how to make it get formatted properly?

--> ok so it seems that when you export from sipmlystatic, then open the html file on my machine it's corrupted, but when gh pages serves that index.html page it seems fine tbh
