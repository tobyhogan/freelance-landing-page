- docs contains the static site usable by gh pages



local:
- tried opening site files copied from the gh repo using local on the win11 pc, didn't work
- opened the same site files(for tobyhogan-space on my laptop macosx and it did work ), although not sure why
    - perhaps local is too local and some files are only stored on machine?


-> I got it to work by exporting the site when it was working from the laptop through local, then importing it through local on the desktop
